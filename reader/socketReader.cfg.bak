# socketReader config file


# This section is where standard config stuff goes.
[general]

# Logging options
# NOTE: Leave logfile blank for no logging.
logfile = c:/wamp/www/hema_hl7/transmission.log
# NOTE: possible log levels in ascending verbosity are: 
#       critical, error, warning, prod, info, debug
loglvl = critical

# Here you state the connections you want to use. You need to provide a 
# comma separated list here.
# Example: useconnections = sockstreamin, fileout
# useconnections = incoming_socket, outgoing_socket, incoming_file, outgoing_file

useconnections =  incoming_socket

[incoming_socket]
queuename = socket-to-file
# The connection type is defined by two options describing message transmission 
# technique and transfer direction. 
# Message transmission techniques are provided by the option transtech.
# Possible message transmission techniques are: socket, file
transtech = socket
# Message transfer directions are provided by the option transdir. 
# Possible transfer directions are: in, out
transdir = in
# State if this connection is used for HL7 communications
# NOTE: This must be set to True if you wish to use the hl7prefix option. 
usehl7 = True
# Define if to use acknowledgement messages or not. Depending on the setting 
# of the usehl7 option, HL7 or MLLP acks will be sent.
useack = True
# Give options for a socket connection
# NOTE: Set createserversocket to True if you want socketReader to works as 
#       socket server. Set it to False if you want socketReader to work as 
#       a socket client.
createserversocket = True
# NOTE: When defining a socket client, ipaddr must be set to the remote 
#       machine's IP address socketReader should connect to. When defining a 
#       socket server, you may give the IP of any local TCP/IP network 
#       interface. If you leave this blank, the local default NIC will be used. 
ipaddr = 192.168.11.15
# NOTE: In server mode, port describes the local port the server socket will 
#       listen on. In client mode, socketReader will try to connect to port 
#       on the remote machine. If empty, port defaults to 22222.
port = 5100
# MLLP special characters
# NOTE: If you want to redefine these special characters, uncomment the
#       three lines below. You need to provide Python syntax here, like:
#       chr(<ascii table entry number for your desired char>) which can be 
#       hexadecimal as shown below or decimal.  
sob = chr(0x0B)
eob = chr(0x1C)
eod = chr(0x0D)
# NOTE: The same would be achieved by: eod = chr(13) 
# Debug options:
# NOTE: This connector does not support any debug options. Whatever you state 
#       here will be discarded. However, socketReader will exit with an error
#       upon syntax errors.
#debug = {}
